The receipts and disbursements\nare shown under three parts in which Government Accounts are kept viz., (i) The Consolidated\nFund of India, (ii) The Contingency Fund of India and (iii) The Public Account of India. The\nAnnual Financial Statement distinguishes the expenditure on revenue account from the\nexpenditure on other accounts, as is mandated in the Constitution of India. The Revenue and\nthe Capital sections together, make the Union Budget. The estimates of receipts and\nexpenditure included in the Annual Financial Statement are net of refunds and recoveries\nrespectively.\nThe significance of the Consolidated Fund, the Contingency Fund and the Public Account\nas well as the distinguishing features of the Revenue and the Capital portions are given below\nbriefly:\n(i)The Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) draws its existence from Article 266 of the\nConstitution. All revenues received by the Government, loans raised by it, and also receipts\nfrom recoveries of loans granted by it, together form the Consolidated Fund of India. All\nexpenditure of the Government is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India and no amount\ncan be drawn from the Consolidated Fund without due authorization from the Parliament.\n(ii)Article 267 of the Constitution authorizes the existence of a Contingency Fund of India\nwhich is an imprest placed at the disposal of the President of India to facilitate meeting of\nurgent unforeseen expenditure by the Government pending authorization from the Parliament.\nParliamentary approval for such unforeseen expenditure is obtained, ex- post-facto, and an\nequivalent amount is drawn from the Consolidated Fund to recoup the Contingency Fund\nafter such ex-post-facto approval. The corpus of the Contingency Fund as authorized by\nParliament presently stands at `30,000  crore.\n(iii)Moneys held by Government in trust are kept in the Public Account. The Public Account\ndraws its existence from Article 266 of the Constitution of India. Provident Funds, Small Savings\ncollections, receipts of Government set apart for expenditure on specific objects such as road\ndevelopment, primary education, other Reserve/Special Funds etc., are examples of moneys\nkept in the Public Account. Public Account funds that do not belong to the Government and\nhave to be finally paid back to the persons and authorities, who deposited them, do not require\nParliamentary authorization for withdrawals. The approval of the Parliament is obtained when\namounts are withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund and kept in the Public Account for\nexpenditure on specific objects (The actual expenditure on the specific object is again submitted\nfor vote of the Parliament for withdrawal from the Public Account for incurring expenditure on\nthe specific objects). The Union Budget can be demarcated into the part pertaining to revenue\nwhich is for ease of reference termed as Revenue Budget in (iv) below and the part pertaining\nto Capital which is for ease of reference termed as Capital Budget in (v) below.\n(iv) The Revenue Budget consists of the revenue receipts of the Government (Tax revenues\nand Non-Tax revenues) and the revenue expenditure. Tax revenues comprise proceeds of\ntaxes and other duties levied by the Union. The estimates of revenue receipts shown in the\nAnnual Financial Statement take into account the effect of various taxation proposals made in\nthe Finance Bill. Non-tax receipts of the Government mainly consist of interest and dividend\non investments made by the Government, fees and other receipts for services rendered by\nthe Government. Revenue expenditure is for the normal running of Government Departments\nand for rendering of various services, making interest payments on debt, meeting subsidies,\n11\ngrants in aid, etc. Broadly, the expenditure which does not result in creation of assets for the\nGovernment of India, is treated as revenue expenditure. All grants given to the State\nGovernments/Union Territories and other parties are also treated as revenue expenditure\neven though some of the grants may be used for creation of capital assets.\n(v)Capital receipts and capital payments together constitute the Capital Budget. The capital\nreceipts are loans raised by the Government from the public (these are termed as market\nloans), borrowings by the Government through the sale of Treasury Bills, the loans received\nfrom foreign Governments and bodies, disinvestment receipts and recoveries of loans from\nState and Union Territory Governments and other parties. Capital payments consist of capital\nexpenditure on acquisition of assets like land, buildings, machinery, equipment, as also\ninvestments in shares, etc., and loans and advances granted by the Central Government to\nthe  State and the Union Territory Governments, Government companies, Corporations and\nother parties.\n(vi)Accounting Classification\n\u2022The estimates of receipts and disbursements in the Annual Financial Statement and of\nexpenditure in the Demands for Grants are shown according to the accounting classification\nreferred to under Article 150 of the Constitution.\n\u2022The Annual Financial Statement shows, certain disbursements distinctly, which are\ncharged on the Consolidated Fund of India. The Constitution of India mandates that such\nitems of expenditure such as emoluments of the President, salaries and allowances of the\nChairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the Deputy\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha, salaries, allowances and pensions of the Judges of the Supreme\nCourt, the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India and the Central Vigilance Commission,\ninterest on and repayment of loans raised by the Government and payments made to satisfy\ndecrees of courts etc., may be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and are not required\nto be voted by the Lok Sabha.\nB.Demands for Grants\n(i)Article 113 of the Constitution mandates that the estimates of expenditure from the\nConsolidated Fund of India included in the Annual Financial Statement and required to be\nvoted by the Lok Sabha, be submitted in the form of Demands for Grants. The Demands for\nGrants are presented to the Lok Sabha along with the Annual Financial Statement. Generally,\none Demand for Grant is presented in respect of each Ministry or Department. However,\nmore than one Demand may be presented for a Ministry or Department depending on the\nnature of expenditure. With regard to Union Territories without Legislature, a separate\nDemand is presented for each of such Union Territories. In Budget 2023-24 there are 102\nDemands for Grants. Each Demand initially gives separately the totals of (i) \u2018voted\u2019 and\n\u2018charged\u2019 expenditure; (ii) the \u2018revenue\u2019 and the \u2018capital\u2019 expenditure and (iii) the grand total\non gross basis of the amount of expenditure for which the Demand is presented. This is\nfollowed by the estimates of expenditure under different major heads of account. The amounts\nof recoveries are also shown. The net amount of expenditure after reducing the recoveries\nfrom the gross amount is also shown.  A summary of Demands for Grants is given at the\nbeginning of this document, while details of \u2018New Service\u2019 or \u2018New Instrument of Service\u2019\nsuch as, formation of a new company, undertaking or a new scheme, etc., if any, are indicated\nat the end of the document.\n12\n(ii)Each Demand normally includes the total provisions required for a service, that is,\nprovisions on account of revenue expenditure, capital expenditure, grants to State and Union\nTerritory Governments and also loans and advances relating to the service. Where the provision\nfor a service is entirely for expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, for example,\nInterest Payments (Demand for Grant No. 39), a separate Appropriation, as distinct from a\nDemand, is presented for that expenditure and it is not required to be voted by the Lok Sabha.\nWhere, however, expenditure on a service includes both \u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 items of\nexpenditure, the latter are also included in the Demand presented for that service but the\n\u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 provisions are shown separately in that Demand.\nC.Finance Bill\nAt the time of presentation of the Annual Financial Statement before the Parliament, a\nFinance Bill is also presented in fulfillment of the requirement of Article 110 (1)(a) of the\nConstitution, detailing the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of taxes\nproposed in the Budget.

It\nsets out the three-year rolling targets for specific fiscal indicators in relation to GDP at market\nprices, namely (i) Fiscal Deficit, (ii) Revenue Deficit, (iii) Primary Deficit (iv) Tax Revenue (v)\nNon-tax Revenue and (vi) Central Government Debt. The Statement includes the underlying\nassumptions, an assessment of the balance between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure\nand the use of capital receipts including market borrowings for the creation of productive\nassets.  It also outlines for the existing financial year, the strategic priorities of the Governmen t\nrelating to taxation, expenditure, borrowings, guarantees etc. The Statement explains how\nthe current fiscal policies are in conformity with sound fiscal management principles and\ngives the rationale for any major deviation in key fiscal measures.\n2.2Explanatory Documents:\nTo facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the major features of the Budget,\ncertain other explanatory documents are presented.

This document provides details of resources transferred by\nthe Central Government to State and Union Territory Governments. This document also shows\nthe revenue deficit, the gross primary deficit and the gross fiscal deficit of the Central\nGovernment. The excess of Government\u2019s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts\nconstitutes revenue deficit of Government. The difference between the total expenditure of\nGovernment by way of revenue, capital and loans net of repayments on the one hand and\nrevenue receipts of Government and capital receipts which are not in the nature of borrowing\nbut which accrue to Government on the other, constitutes gross fiscal deficit. Gross Primary\ndeficit is gross fiscal deficit reduced by the gross interest payments. In the Budget documents\n\u2018gross fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018gross primary deficit\u2019 have been referred to in abbreviated form \u2018fiscal\ndeficit\u2019 and \u2018primary deficit\u2019, respectively.\n(ii)The document also includes a statement indicating the quantum and nature (share in\nCentral Taxes, grants/loan) of the total Resources transferred to States and Union Territory\nGovernments.

The Budget\nreflects and shapes, and is, in turn, shaped by the country\u2019s economy. For a better appreciation\nof the impact of government receipts and expenditure on the other sectors of the economy, it\nis necessary to group them in terms of certain economic magnitudes, for example, how much\nis set aside for capital formation, how much is spent directly by the Government and how\nmuch is transferred by Government to other sectors of the economy by way of grants, loans,\netc. This analysis is contained in the Economic and Functional Classification of the Central\nGovernment Budget which is brought out by the Ministry of Finance separately.\nI.Memorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill\nTo facilitate understanding of the taxation proposals contained in the finance Bill, the\nprovisions and their implications are explained in the document titled Memorandum Explaining\nthe Provisions in the Finance Bill.\nJ.Output Outcome Monitoring Framework\nOutput-Outcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF) for Central Sector Schemes (CSs) and\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) with financial outlay of `500 crore and more each, will\nbe laid in the House along with Budget 2023-24.

Hindi version of all these documents is also presented to the Parliament. The Budget\ndocuments can be accessed at http://indiabudget.gov.in.\n2.1A brief description of the Budget documents listed above is as follows:\nA.Annual Financial Statement (AFS)\nThe Annual Financial Statement (AFS), the document as provided under Article 112, shows\nthe estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for 2023-24 along with\n10\nestimates for 2022-23 as also actuals for the year 2021-22. The receipts and disbursements\nare shown under three parts in which Government Accounts are kept viz., (i) The Consolidated\nFund of India, (ii) The Contingency Fund of India and (iii) The Public Account of India. The\nAnnual Financial Statement distinguishes the expenditure on revenue account from the\nexpenditure on other accounts, as is mandated in the Constitution of India. The Revenue and\nthe Capital sections together, make the Union Budget. The estimates of receipts and\nexpenditure included in the Annual Financial Statement are net of refunds and recoveries\nrespectively.\nThe significance of the Consolidated Fund, the Contingency Fund and the Public Account\nas well as the distinguishing features of the Revenue and the Capital portions are given below\nbriefly:\n(i)The Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) draws its existence from Article 266 of the\nConstitution. All revenues received by the Government, loans raised by it, and also receipts\nfrom recoveries of loans granted by it, together form the Consolidated Fund of India. All\nexpenditure of the Government is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India and no amount\ncan be drawn from the Consolidated Fund without due authorization from the Parliament.\n(ii)Article 267 of the Constitution authorizes the existence of a Contingency Fund of India\nwhich is an imprest placed at the disposal of the President of India to facilitate meeting of\nurgent unforeseen expenditure by the Government pending authorization from the Parliament.\nParliamentary approval for such unforeseen expenditure is obtained, ex- post-facto, and an\nequivalent amount is drawn from the Consolidated Fund to recoup the Contingency Fund\nafter such ex-post-facto approval. The corpus of the Contingency Fund as authorized by\nParliament presently stands at `30,000  crore.\n(iii)Moneys held by Government in trust are kept in the Public Account. The Public Account\ndraws its existence from Article 266 of the Constitution of India. Provident Funds, Small Savings\ncollections, receipts of Government set apart for expenditure on specific objects such as road\ndevelopment, primary education, other Reserve/Special Funds etc., are examples of moneys\nkept in the Public Account. Public Account funds that do not belong to the Government and\nhave to be finally paid back to the persons and authorities, who deposited them, do not require\nParliamentary authorization for withdrawals. The approval of the Parliament is obtained when\namounts are withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund and kept in the Public Account for\nexpenditure on specific objects (The actual expenditure on the specific object is again submitted\nfor vote of the Parliament for withdrawal from the Public Account for incurring expenditure on\nthe specific objects). The Union Budget can be demarcated into the part pertaining to revenue\nwhich is for ease of reference termed as Revenue Budget in (iv) below and the part pertaining\nto Capital which is for ease of reference termed as Capital Budget in (v) below.\n(iv) The Revenue Budget consists of the revenue receipts of the Government (Tax revenues\nand Non-Tax revenues) and the revenue expenditure. Tax revenues comprise proceeds of\ntaxes and other duties levied by the Union. The estimates of revenue receipts shown in the\nAnnual Financial Statement take into account the effect of various taxation proposals made in\nthe Finance Bill. Non-tax receipts of the Government mainly consist of interest and dividend\non investments made by the Government, fees and other receipts for services rendered by\nthe Government. Revenue expenditure is for the normal running of Government Departments\nand for rendering of various services, making interest payments on debt, meeting subsidies,\n11\ngrants in aid, etc. Broadly, the expenditure which does not result in creation of assets for the\nGovernment of India, is treated as revenue expenditure. All grants given to the State\nGovernments/Union Territories and other parties are also treated as revenue expenditure\neven though some of the grants may be used for creation of capital assets.\n(v)Capital receipts and capital payments together constitute the Capital Budget. The capital\nreceipts are loans raised by the Government from the public (these are termed as market\nloans), borrowings by the Government through the sale of Treasury Bills, the loans received\nfrom foreign Governments and bodies, disinvestment receipts and recoveries of loans from\nState and Union Territory Governments and other parties. Capital payments consist of capital\nexpenditure on acquisition of assets like land, buildings, machinery, equipment, as also\ninvestments in shares, etc., and loans and advances granted by the Central Government to\nthe  State and the Union Territory Governments, Government companies, Corporations and\nother parties.\n(vi)Accounting Classification\n\u2022The estimates of receipts and disbursements in the Annual Financial Statement and of\nexpenditure in the Demands for Grants are shown according to the accounting classification\nreferred to under Article 150 of the Constitution.\n\u2022The Annual Financial Statement shows, certain disbursements distinctly, which are\ncharged on the Consolidated Fund of India. The Constitution of India mandates that such\nitems of expenditure such as emoluments of the President, salaries and allowances of the\nChairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the Deputy\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha, salaries, allowances and pensions of the Judges of the Supreme\nCourt, the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India and the Central Vigilance Commission,\ninterest on and repayment of loans raised by the Government and payments made to satisfy\ndecrees of courts etc., may be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and are not required\nto be voted by the Lok Sabha.\nB.Demands for Grants\n(i)Article 113 of the Constitution mandates that the estimates of expenditure from the\nConsolidated Fund of India included in the Annual Financial Statement and required to be\nvoted by the Lok Sabha, be submitted in the form of Demands for Grants. The Demands for\nGrants are presented to the Lok Sabha along with the Annual Financial Statement. Generally,\none Demand for Grant is presented in respect of each Ministry or Department. However,\nmore than one Demand may be presented for a Ministry or Department depending on the\nnature of expenditure. With regard to Union Territories without Legislature, a separate\nDemand is presented for each of such Union Territories. In Budget 2023-24 there are 102\nDemands for Grants. Each Demand initially gives separately the totals of (i) \u2018voted\u2019 and\n\u2018charged\u2019 expenditure; (ii) the \u2018revenue\u2019 and the \u2018capital\u2019 expenditure and (iii) the grand total\non gross basis of the amount of expenditure for which the Demand is presented. This is\nfollowed by the estimates of expenditure under different major heads of account. The amounts\nof recoveries are also shown. The net amount of expenditure after reducing the recoveries\nfrom the gross amount is also shown.  A summary of Demands for Grants is given at the\nbeginning of this document, while details of \u2018New Service\u2019 or \u2018New Instrument of Service\u2019\nsuch as, formation of a new company, undertaking or a new scheme, etc., if any, are indicated\nat the end of the document.\n12\n(ii)Each Demand normally includes the total provisions required for a service, that is,\nprovisions on account of revenue expenditure, capital expenditure, grants to State and Union\nTerritory Governments and also loans and advances relating to the service. Where the provision\nfor a service is entirely for expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, for example,\nInterest Payments (Demand for Grant No. 39), a separate Appropriation, as distinct from a\nDemand, is presented for that expenditure and it is not required to be voted by the Lok Sabha.\nWhere, however, expenditure on a service includes both \u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 items of\nexpenditure, the latter are also included in the Demand presented for that service but the\n\u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 provisions are shown separately in that Demand.\nC.Finance Bill\nAt the time of presentation of the Annual Financial Statement before the Parliament, a\nFinance Bill is also presented in fulfillment of the requirement of Article 110 (1)(a) of the\nConstitution, detailing the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of taxes\nproposed in the Budget. It also contains other provisions relating to Budget that could be\nclassified as Money Bill. A Finance Bill is a Money Bill as defined in Article 110 of the Constituti on.\nD.  Fiscal Policy Statements mandated under FRBM Act.\ni. Macro-Economic Framework Statement\nThe Macro-economic Framework Statement is presented to Parliament under Section 3 of\nthe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 and the rules made thereunder.\nIt contains an assessment of the growth prospects of the economy along with the statement of\nspecific underlying assumptions. It also contains an assessment regarding the GDP growth\nrate, the domestic economy and the stability of the external sector of the economy, fiscal\nbalance of the Central Government and the external sector balance of the economy.\nii.Medium-Term Fiscal Policy cum Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement\nThe Medium-Term Fiscal Policy cum Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement is presented to\nParliament under Section 3 of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. It\nsets out the three-year rolling targets for specific fiscal indicators in relation to GDP at market\nprices, namely (i) Fiscal Deficit, (ii) Revenue Deficit, (iii) Primary Deficit (iv) Tax Revenue (v)\nNon-tax Revenue and (vi) Central Government Debt. The Statement includes the underlying\nassumptions, an assessment of the balance between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure\nand the use of capital receipts including market borrowings for the creation of productive\nassets.  It also outlines for the existing financial year, the strategic priorities of the Governmen t\nrelating to taxation, expenditure, borrowings, guarantees etc. The Statement explains how\nthe current fiscal policies are in conformity with sound fiscal management principles and\ngives the rationale for any major deviation in key fiscal measures.\n2.2Explanatory Documents:\nTo facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the major features of the Budget,\ncertain other explanatory documents are presented. These are briefly summarized below:\nE.Expenditure Budget\nThe provisions made for a scheme or a programme may be spread over a number of\nMajor Heads in the Revenue and Capital sections in a Demand for Grants. In the Expenditure\n13\nBudget, the estimates made for a scheme/programme are brought together and shown on a\nnet basis on Revenue and Capital basis at one place. Expenditure of individual Ministries/\nDepartments are classified under 2 broad Umbrellas (i) Centres\u2019 Expenditures and (ii) Transfers\nto States/ Union Territories (UTs). Under the Umbrella of Centres\u2019 Expenditure there are 3\nsub-classification (a) Establishment expenditure of the Centre (b) Central Sector Schemes\nand (iii) Other Central Expenditure including those on Central Public Sector Enterprises\n(CPSEs) and Autonomous Bodies.\nThe Umbrella of Transfers to States/UTs includes the following 3 sub- classification:\n(a)Centrally Sponsored Scheme\n(b)Finance Commission Transfers\n(c)Other Transfer to States\nTo understand the objectives underlying the expenditure proposed for various schemes\nand programmes in the Expenditure Budget, suitable explanatory notes are included in this\nvolume.\nF.Receipt Budget\nEstimates of receipts included in the Annual Financial Statement are further analyzed in\nthe document \u201cReceipt Budget\u201d. The document provides details of tax and non-tax revenue\nreceipts and capital receipts and explains the estimates. The document also provides a\nstatement on the arrears of tax revenues and non-tax revenues, as mandated under the\nFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules, 2004. Trend of receipts and expenditure\nalong with deficit indicators, statement pertaining to National Small Savings Fund (NSSF),\nStatement of Liabilities, Statement of Guarantees given by the government, statements of\nAssets and details of External Assistance are also included in Receipts Budget. This also\nincludes the Statement of Revenue Impact of Tax Incentives under the Central Tax System\nwhich seeks to list the revenue impact of tax incentives that are proposed by the Central\nGovernment (This was earlier called \u2018Statement of Revenue Foregone\u2019 and brought out as a\nseparate statement).  The statement is given as an annexure to the Receipts Budget from\nBudget 2016-17 onwards. This document also shows liabilities of the Government on account\nof securities (bonds) issued in lieu of oil and fertilizer subsidies in the past.\nG.Expenditure Profile\n(i)This document was earlier titled Expenditure Budget - Vol-I. It has been recast in line\nwith the decision on Plan-Non Plan merger. It gives an aggregation of various types of\nexpenditure and certain other items across demands.\n(ii)Under the present accounting and budgetary procedures, certain classes of receipts,\nsuch as payments made by one Department to another and receipts of capital projects or\nschemes, are taken in reduction of the expenditure of the receiving Department.  While the\nestimates of expenditure included in the Demands for Grants are for the gross amounts, the\nestimates of expenditure included in the Annual Financial Statement are for the net expenditure,\nafter taking into account the recoveries.
